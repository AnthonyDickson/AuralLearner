## Voice Control

Say 'menu' to activate voice control. At present you can say either 'greeting' or 'count'. Saying 'greeting' will make the app say 'hello', and saying 'count' will make the app count from one to ten. These are just for testing purposes and to demonstrate that the voice control is working.

## FFT Test

A basic activity has been set up which uses a FFT algorithm to convert mic input to a frequency. This frequency is shown in a text view in the UI activity. The fft algorithm runs on a non-UI thread. This activity can be accesed from the main menu under the menu entry 'FFT TEST'.
