    <string name="melodiesMenu_difficultyHelpText">The melodies exercise has three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard.
        Similar to the scale exercises, each level of difficulty adds more scales, from which the melodies are created.
        \nThe level of difficulty also makes the melodies more challenging by: increasing the length of the melody;
        increasing the maximum jump between notes in the melody; increasing the range of the melody;
        and reversing the direction of the melody with increasing chance.

        \nThe scales tested for each difficulty are as follows:
        \n\nThe easy difficulty will test you on the Major scale and the Pentatonic Major scale.
        \n\nMedium will add the scales: Natural Minor, and Pentatonic Minor.
        \n\nThe hard difficulty will add the scales: Harmonic Minor, and Melodic Minor.</string>
