I'm just typing what Johnny says. 20/4/18

First of all, it's going to run through headphones.
Second of all, normal reference pitch gets louder, noise gets quieter
A file full of white noise gets quieter as they get more accurate
It won't be a huge deal with the noise, it'll be half the volume of the regular sine wave and the noise will disappear and you'll only be 
able to hear the sine wave when you're 100% accurate.
It'll start at half the volume and then it'll get quieter from there.

Headphone version + non-headphone version (so hardware isn't required)
Non-headphone version requires either figuring out how to cancel out a sine wave coming out of a phone (possibly calibration) or staggering
