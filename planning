 

Killing two birds with one stone - hands free and blind
people (voice activated)
We’re targeting blind musicians who want to learn music theory and ear
training/aural music theory based on apps/games like Singstar (same principal
for pitch recognition and whatnot) and the principals of a chromatic guitar
tuner app


Both PC Java and Android Java and potentially if possible
run it through different types of phones


Two different phone brands - different hardware


 Android tablets too


The options for the visually impaired to learn music theory
and music theory ear training are limited and expensive usually requiring
cumbersome CD's or 1 on 1 tuition. This app will allow blind people to learn
many of the aural components of music theory on their own assuming they can use
a device (android phone) running java. This also has the side effect of being
useable by people who lack hands since it will be voice controlled and will
feature an instructive GUI. Mostly about pitch matching. Can be used as a tool to
learn singing and whistling.


There will be many traditional theory exercises such as
pitch matching, intervals, melody dictation which will allow the person to
learn tonal part of aural training (potentially rhythm).


This app is different to many of the previous apps because
instead of just on-screen confirmation; another pitch will sound that represents
their pitch(different waveform sound from the target) which removes the need
for a graphical GUI


It will use the systems voice recognition for navigation
through the exercises, pitch recognition libraries will be used for pitch,
premade sounds will be recorded for examples or synthesized. GUI easy to draw
(GUI last maybe). Music exercises will need to be written. The skills to continue
completing the exercises will need to become more difficult to stimulate the
learning process.


We should research how long it'll take


What are we building, who's doing it, who's doing what, how
we’re doing it, what platforms we’re doing it on, how long it’ll take to build,
what disabilities we’re working with, how that disability effects the use of
our chosen device, how we’ll support people with that disability




 





To begin with – find the libraries and how to use them,
figure out what already exists that we can just pull from Sourceforge or whatever,
make a Gantt chart
                -voice activation
libraries
                -general Java app
libraries for Android


Near the start – voice activation
                -some way of navigating
the menus
                -voice activation
libraries


After that - pitch matching to the recording, some example
theory exercises


After that – develop a progression of exercises, GUI
                -first component would be
pitch matching (purely to learn how to sing the correct pitch)
                -second component would be
phrase matching (being able to do phrases of notes)
                -


After that – reward system of some kind (points or whatever
if we can be bothered)


After that – more theory exercises




 





 


Three assignments for three people


Rory’s assignment:
                -make a final judgement
about whether it’s actually viable to do this
                -see if we can find all
the necessary libraries/resources/information and compile as much as 
                we can, maybe put it in a
Word document and put it on Github
                -make a case for iOS vs
Android


Johnny’s assignment
                -make a final judgement
about whether it’s actually viable to do this
                -see if we can find all
the necessary libraries/resources/information and compile as much as 
                we can, maybe put it in a
Word document and put it on Github
                -make a case for iOS vs
Android


Anthony’s assignment
                -voice control
                -menu navigation
                -getting it to go through
different menus
                -just kind of look into it
at this stage and figure out if it’s viable with Java and the hardware  
                of a phone I guess
                -make a case for iOS vs
Android


 


Public class wastingtime{


                Public static
void main(String[] args){


                                While(true){


                                                System.out.println(“Wasting
time”);


                                }


                }


}


Distant future
 -multiple user profiles
 -blind mode vs gui mode
 -microwaves and watches
